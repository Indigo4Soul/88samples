    <h1>88samples</h1>
    <p>  Lover of all things vintage and cultural.  Inspired by organic silhouettes and abstracted aesthetics, I am moved by life's journey and perspective.  88samples honors my multifaceted world of craft, creation, and collection.  In crafting and creating art, I aim to promote self-healing and self-love through the fusion of earth's precious minerals with design for body adornment.  In collecting period pieces and thrifted goods, I pay homage to all the creators before me that influenced and spear-headed culture. My first collection under 88samples, 'Angles'  was inspired by my transition into the world of Motherhood.  I explore femininity and womanhood through the guise of African waist beading.  Traditionally, African beading was worn as a decorative commemoration for maturity and growth, sexuality, and body shaping in women and girls.  The color palette around 'Angles' intermixes bold saturated colors with nudes and shades.  The gemstones incorporated merges both earth and woman energies; creator of all things Mother and Earth.  I celebrate women for their intensity and vulnerability. #CrownsUp</p>
